Store Simulation App written with [React](https://reactjs.org/),
[Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/),
[Chartjs](http://www.chartjs.org/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It mimics some of the behavior of a store App in which the admin can add items to sell at a given price. Added items are randomly generated sold amounts for displaying purposes. Items can be sorted by price or amount sold. The items are then rendered dynamically to the page.
