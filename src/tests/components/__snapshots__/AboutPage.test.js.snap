        The App is built with React, Redux, Bootstrap, Firebase, and Chartjs. It is deployed using Heroku. It mimics some of the behavior of a store App in which the admin can add items to sell at a given price. Added items are randomly generated sold amounts for 4 months for displaying purposes. Items can be sorted by price or amount sold. The items are then rendered dynamically to the page.
